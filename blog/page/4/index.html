      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>So, today I spoke to the Electoral Commission. In my last post, I made a bunch of assumptions based on reading their website about what was legal and what wasn&rsquo;t. Today I checked all that with them, and was pretty much right, thankfully.</p>

<p>The Commission offices all have their <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/contact-us/our-offices">phone numbers online</a>, and connect you straight to people who can answer your questions. I highly recommend giving them a call if you&rsquo;re considering this yourself.</p>

<p>So, what did we find out? (By the way &ndash; don&rsquo;t take this as solid legal advice, it&rsquo;s just my own interpretation, not guaranteed fact)</p>

<h2>Standing</h2>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many rules around actually standing. First of all, it&rsquo;s perfectly legal to announce that you intend to, as I have. You don&rsquo;t have to have anything &ldquo;official&rdquo; in place first.</p>

<p>The regulated campaigning period doesn&rsquo;t start until mid-December, so until then, you can do what you like. After that, things become a little more regulated financially, but more of that later.</p>

<p>As for registering as a candidate, or as a party, that all comes a lot later. The deadlines will be a few weeks before the election itself, so the official signing of things can be put off for a good while yet. Parties can be registered until a little while before the actual candidate nomination deadline, so we&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to decide if this gets branded with a party name or not.</p>

<h2>Spending</h2>

<p>There was a bit more around finances, but again this only takes effect during the regulated period. There is a period starting in mid-December called the &ldquo;Long Campaign&rdquo;, which changes to the &ldquo;Short Campaign&rdquo; nearer the actual election date. Each period has different spending limits, but I&rsquo;m not worrying about that too much yet.</p>

<p>You need to report all spending on the campaign to the Commission, but it&rsquo;s just a matter of keeping simple books of expenditure. No rocket science here, and in my case I&rsquo;m going to have it all open anyway. Again, this doesn&rsquo;t take effect until the start of the Long Campaign, but I&rsquo;ll probably start now anyway.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you start campaigning early, but don&rsquo;t officially register until later, the need to keep the books applies retroactively, so just get ahead and make sure you keep track from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Raising money</h2>

<p>This was the interesting bit.</p>

<p>You can raise money to spend during your campaign any way you like, but you must disclose who your donors are. For independent candidates, all donations over £50 must be disclosed &ndash; the figure for parties is higher, I think.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that all donors must be on the electoral roll, and <em>you</em> have to verify this. This makes crowdfunding interesting. Apparently some people have tried it, but found it very hard to get the right information to check that their donors are legal. I&rsquo;m hoping to start a conversation with crowdfunding organisations <em>now</em> to try to get this sorted out so I can do things that way.</p>

<p>To summarise, so far, the legalities around standing for election are pretty minimal. Just a bit of bookkeeping, and making sure your money comes from the right places. Should be even easier with the kind of radically transparent approach I&rsquo;ll be taking.</p>

<p>On to the next step!</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>A few days ago, I announced that <a href="/blog/2014/06/27/standing-for-parliament-in-2015">I intend to stand for Parliament next May</a>. Since then, I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of really great feedback (thank you all!), suggestions, and questions. Lots of questions have been about the process of standing, and about how complex it is.</p>

<p>The entertaining thing is that I&rsquo;ve had to answer most these with an &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, as I really don&rsquo;t at this stage. Really all I&rsquo;ve got so far is an intent, a lack of self-control, and am comfortable with the fact that <a href="http://codon.com/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing">I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/739/fa5.jpg" alt="I have no idea what I'm doing" /></p>

<p>However, my campaign is all about openness, so I&rsquo;m going to blog the whole thing as I go along and learn what&rsquo;s what. Watch this space, and I&rsquo;ll walk you through the entire process, and maybe remove some of the fear so that you can do it too. I&rsquo;ll also try to distill the knowledge into a guide of some sort as I go along &ndash; more on that later.</p>

<p>Here goes, anyway. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened up until now.</p>

<h2>Making the decision</h2>

<p>Step one in all this is perhaps the biggest. However, all you need is a desire to make the world better, to have the realisation that democracy needs people to stand up for what they believe in, and that if nobody else will do it, you&rsquo;d better take it on yourself.</p>

<p>You should have some idea what you want to stand for at this point, but I don&rsquo;t think it has to be final and polished. The joy of the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a> is that it will keep being refined and improved right up until the election (and beyond). It&rsquo;s essential to expose your ideas to some criticism and discussion though; it&rsquo;s a great way to refine them, and they <em>will</em> be challenged later.</p>

<p>A few people have asked why I&rsquo;m standing in Horsham, which will be a hard fight. Honestly, it never occurred to stand anywhere other than where I live &ndash; why would anyone vote for me if I have no connection with the area? The parachuting-in of candidates is one broken aspect of our system if you ask me. Anyway&hellip;</p>

<h2>Talking about it</h2>

<p>The first person I discussed it with was, of course, my wife Amanda, who would probably much rather I kept to myself, but knows me too well to expect me to. If this is something you&rsquo;re going to do, you&rsquo;ve got to have your family on board. I&rsquo;ve made a promise to her that I&rsquo;ll try to keep the time spent under control, and if this starts to have an effect on the time I spend with my children, then I&rsquo;ll stop. They come first. Obviously this will be hardest in the immediate run-up to the election, but it&rsquo;s the right aim to have.</p>

<p>Once she was on board, I told my bosses at the <a href="http://theodi.org">ODI</a>, and a few close friends with interests in the area. All the feedback was very positive, which was really great. Your extended networks will be a massive source of power and support, and far from getting the expected &ldquo;why the hell would you do that&rdquo; response, I&rsquo;ve had a massive outpouring of support, respect, and admiration for doing it. Win.</p>

<h2>Checking the law</h2>

<p>So, time to tell the world.</p>

<p>Hmm; perhaps I&rsquo;d better check it&rsquo;s legal first.</p>

<p>I spent a bit of time looking at the <a href="http://electoralcommission.org.uk">Electoral Commission</a> website, which looks nice but leads you in circles a bit, and doesn&rsquo;t currently have guidance for people standing in UK parliamentary elections in 2015. Obviously I&rsquo;m a bit ahead of the game here.</p>

<p>Cobbling together information from byelection guidance, and other sources,  it seems fairly simple. There are spending limits on election campaigning while you&rsquo;re a candidate, and some other rules, but the <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/162724/reg-period-timeline-candidate.pdf">actual time you are an official candidate is quite short</a>. There is something about a &ldquo;long campaign&rdquo; and a &ldquo;short campaign&rdquo; in there, but the rules only seem to apply once certain dates are passed. The long campaign starts in mid-December, so I&rsquo;m basically ignoring it for now. As far as I can tell, that&rsquo;s the only point that accounts and things have to be kept, though I am going to start keeping track of costs etc. now (in public of course).</p>

<p>So, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you announcing an intention. When it comes to actually registering, you have to submit nomination papers with 10 signatures from your constituency, and a £500 deposit. The deadline is really quite close to the election itself though, so that&rsquo;s a long way off.</p>

<p>You get your deposit back if you gain 5% of the votes cast; in Horsham I think that&rsquo;s about 2800 based on the numbers at the last election. I intend to find a way to crowdfund that deposit, btw; not because I can&rsquo;t afford it, but to show others who can&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s not a barrier to participation.</p>

<h2>Time to announce</h2>

<p>So, I think it&rsquo;s legal to do what I&rsquo;m trying to do. I love working in the open, so I guess it&rsquo;s time to tell people! I wrote a blog post, but then realised that people might want to express an interest, so cobbled together a landing page at <a href="http://openhorsham.org.uk">openhorsham.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://mailchimp.com">mailchimp</a> mailing list, and a <a href="http://facebook.com/openhorsham">Facebook</a> page; both were easy to set up, and I should be fine on the free mailchimp plan for a long time. Both will let me get in touch with people who are interested in spreading the word. I&rsquo;m also trying out <a href="http://gosquared.com">GoSquared</a> to count website visitors &ndash; they promise not to share visitor data with others, so it&rsquo;s privacy-friendly.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I chose a Facebook page rather than a group. Facebook doesn&rsquo;t make it massively clear which is appropriate for what, but as this is a contact point for a <em>thing</em>, a page seemed more sensible.</p>

<p>Once that was up, I just needed to wait for the perfect time to launch&hellip;</p>

<p>Actually, no. There&rsquo;s no perfect time. I managed to wait about 10 minutes before I got so itchy about it that I had to just go ahead and publish.</p>

<p>The post went up here and on <a href="http://medium.com">medium</a>. I chose medium because there&rsquo;s no barrier to writing there, but I <em>think</em> people are more inclined to share their links than links to this site.</p>

<h2>What didn&rsquo;t I do?</h2>

<p>Because I did so little before announcing, there&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> I haven&rsquo;t done, but these are the big things that you might think you need first:</p>

<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t assemble a team of helpers. That can come later, and they will choose themselves.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t change my twitter handle (<a href="http://twitter.com/Floppy">@Floppy</a>) &ndash; I am who I am, I&rsquo;m not going to polish my public image.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t chase the media. I thought for a while that I had to, but was reminded that it wasn&rsquo;t my style, so would be the wrong thing to do. They will come to me if they&rsquo;re interested enough.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t agonise over a name for the campaign. I&rsquo;ve used Open Horsham for now, but that can change later &ndash; it&rsquo;s a work in progress.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s happened since?</h2>

<p>Well, today I had my first conversation with a local journalist, so that strategy worked.</p>

<p>Next steps are to get the message spread further (especially locally), and probably organise a get-together in a Horsham pub. I also need to get more content down in the manifesto and attract more contributors there. I&rsquo;ve also got to work out how far I can push the transparency &ndash; can I stream (or at least record and publish later) all the meetings and things I have with people, all the discussions? Someone suggested recording a making-of documentary as I go along. Anyone got a camera and a lot of free time?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very much taking a &ldquo;push it and see what breaks&rdquo; approach to this project, but it&rsquo;s always served me well in the past, so we&rsquo;ll see what happens this time!</p>

<p>Tune in next time to find out what happens when I phone up the South-East Electoral Commission team and see if my assumptions are actually right&hellip; :)</p>

      <p><em>This is part of my series about standing as an MP. See the <a href="/blog/categories/election/">election category</a> for other posts.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got an exciting announcement to make; <strong>in May 2015, I&rsquo;m planning to stand in the
general election to be MP for Horsham</strong>. I&rsquo;ll be running on the
principles in the <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">OpenPolitics Manifesto</a>,
an open source collaborative manifesto that <em>anyone</em> can contribute to; I&rsquo;m reasonably sure that&rsquo;s a world first.</p>

<h2>Why do this?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m an optimist. I look to the future and hope that we can build a brighter, happier, more collaborative, more equal society for everyone, enabled by the best aspects of our technology. I see a future where we can do <em>democracy itself</em> better, where we all have a say in the way we do things together. I realise that&rsquo;s utopian, but I figure that it&rsquo;s better to have a idea of where you want to get to than just stumbling from crisis to crisis without an end goal in mind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion over the last few years that nobody is
representing me or others who are optimistically working towards a better future. I&rsquo;m fed up of the politics of fear, the <a href="https://therearenoothers.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/othering-101-what-is-othering/">othering</a> of the vulnerable, and the misguided doctrine of austerity. I&rsquo;m also frustrated by our lack of sufficient climate action, and our dismal record when adopting supposedly &ldquo;new&rdquo; technologies like the web. The bleak future offered by the current political choices just isn&rsquo;t a place I want to be.</p>

<p>So, I think we can do better, and the right way to deal with that in our current system is <em>provide the option yourself</em> and stand for office.</p>

<h2>Starting something</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m the first to admit that it will be a hard fight; I&rsquo;m standing in a very safe Conservative seat, against Francis Maude, a cabinet minister. However, Horsham is where I live, and so while there are probably easier targets, this one falls to me, and I&rsquo;m ready to take it on.</p>

<p>Also, this isn&rsquo;t simply about winning one seat next May; it&rsquo;s about trying to inspire others to stand across the country on the same platform, and about getting started on the long haul of building a political movement across many years and multiple elections. There is a growing movement towards a more networked citizen-powered form of democracy across the world, and standing on an open-source manifesto is an exciting way to be part of that.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s do it</h2>

<p>In summary; I&rsquo;m not a politician, but I <em>do</em> think things need to change if we&rsquo;re going to build a decent future. If you agree, and like me you can&rsquo;t trust anyone else to fix things for you, stand where <em>you</em> are, and maybe we&rsquo;ll put a party name on this thing.</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s bring an Open Revolution to British politics.</strong></p>

<p><em>If you&rsquo;re in the Horsham area, visit <a href="http://openhorsham.org.uk">openhorsham.org.uk</a> to keep in touch with the campaign when it starts.</em></p>

<p><em>To get involved in writing the manifesto, visit <a href="http://openpolitics.org.uk">openpolitics.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/OpenPoliticsUK">@OpenPoliticsUK</a> on Twitter.</em></p>

<p><em>And finally, you can follow me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/Floppy">@Floppy</a>. If you want to stand where you are, let me know!</em></p>
